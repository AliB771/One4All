Unlike traditional monolithic fine-tuned models, One4All uses a modular architecture with specialized LoRA experts. A lightweight routing engine dynamically selects the most relevant expert for each query, resulting in higher efficiency, reduced inference cost, and more accurate domain-specific responses.
